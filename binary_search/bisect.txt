This file explains the use of bisect_left and bisect_right

Given a target k, if k does not exist in arr[] then bisect_left = bisect_right where
bisect_left = bisect_right = idx of the element > k

e.g: [1,2,3, 5, 6] and target = 4 then bisect_left = bisect_right = 3 (value = 5)
            res

E.g: Given array [1,    2,         2,        3,         5] then:
                    bisect_left         bisect_right

  - bisect_left(2) gives: 1 (idx of the first 2)
  - bisect_right(2) gives: 3 (idx of the last 2 + 1 or the first element > 2 which is 3)

Applications:
  (1) Find the closest element to target k (bisect_left only)
    - 658: Find the closest element to x and do expand window from there.

  (2) Given indices[] in ascending order of an element, and a range [L, R] we can determine # elements [L, R] cover
    - 3104: Use x = bs_left(L), y = bs_right(R) to compute # chars covered = y-x
